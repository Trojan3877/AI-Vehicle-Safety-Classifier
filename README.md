## Overview

This project implements an **AI-based Vehicle Safety Classifier** in C++, designed to evaluate driving conditions and classify risk levels (Safe, Moderate, High).

Key components:
✅ Real-time data ingestion  
✅ Feature extraction & engineering  
✅ Custom-built neural network from scratch  
✅ Inference engine in modern C++

---

## Business Impact

AI-driven **vehicle safety assessment** is critical for:
- Autonomous vehicles (AV)  
- Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)  
- Fleet management optimization  
- Insurance risk modeling  

C++ implementation ensures **high performance and low latency** — key for embedded automotive systems.
